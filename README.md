### Project Title
Exploring US Bike Share Data

### Description
In this python based project, we used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.And compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The Datasets:
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

1- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

1- Gender
2- Birth Year

### Files used
we needed the three city dataset files:

* [chicago.csv]
* [new_york_city.csv]
* [washington.csv]
